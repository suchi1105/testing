Day01 Topic :
=============
class
static
inheritance & composition
inheritance - Object - dynamic binding
abstract class & interface
collections, Collection, List/Set - HashSet & TreeSet, Iterator
Collections - reverse, shuffle, sort, synchronize
Generic
Java 8
lambda expression
default method in interface
Optional
@FunctionalInterface
Streams - filter(), map( ), reduce( )



Assignments :
---------------
1.Change in the Employee program so that set will not allowed to store duplicates
2.show that a base and dervied classes can be genric?
3.Employee use streams map() method  to get only employee id and print using foreach


Static is always ready can be called from anywhere 
But Non static cannt be called directly from static.
If i need data through out the life cycle then only make it static and if not then non static 

Final:
=============
We cannot change its value nor we cannt inherit the final class and ovveride final method


Inheritance: is -a Class B is a type of A
===================
Class A{}

Class B extends A{

}

A obj = new B() ;//it is necessary for run time polymorphism


-------------------------------

Composition: Class D has a C
==============
has a relationship

Class C{

}

Class D
{

c obj ;
}


C obj1 = new D() ;//invalid



Object class method:
====================
toString()
hashCode()
Class getClass()-- final method
equals
wait() -- final method
notify() -- final method
notifyAll()-- final method


Collection:
===============
Size of array is fixed adding any element in between is tidous
Collection :

Class  List                                                                                           Class Set  (duplicates not allowed and insertion order isnot  preserve and traverse in both diresction )
=========		                                                                              ==========
Arraylist(duplicates and insertion order is preserve and traverse in both diresction ) linkedlist      Hashset Treeset Linkedhashset

HAshset is storing duplicates becuase hashcode and equals are not override in the class thats why.

Collections utlity class is there to reverse or shuffle the collection
collection is a interface  and collections is a class.
If we are using any custom class inside treeset then it need any comparator to compare the property otherwise it will give error.

In interface the variable needs to be public static final but in abstract class they can be normal
interface cannot have constructor because they are final and not state is associated because they are final 


default method:
=====================

default method in interface (method can be ovveride)
Static method also in the interface (static method cannot be override) ;


Generic Class :
=================

It is just like a wrappper put anything which ever we give it will take and store it 

Try:

al.stream().filter((e) -> {
    return e.getName().contains("s");
}).forEach((e) -> System.out.println(e)
}) ;


Day 02 :
===============
Assignment :
==============
1.Develop program which causes outofMemory exception?
2.com.eg.sp1 can a protected can be acces in the subpackages also
3.Extract email id from a text file


Topics:
=============
1 .reduce() expect the two values at a time and compare them and return Optional of product type 

//Minimum 
tp.stream().reduce((p1,p2) -> {if (p1.getPrice() < p2.getPrice())
{
return p1;
}
else
{
return p2;
})


2.
For ex:

Tree set has 10 elements 

1. Filter()  : filters the records base on some criteria 
 	 ts.streams().filters((e) -> { return e.getPrice() >20})
   result : will be 0 to 10 element
   result type will be stream so we can again apply filter reduce anything  

	
2.  Reduce() : max/min/avg/count :But in case of reduce the result will  be 1 only like smalllest number so result will be 0 and 1
    but the type of result is optional so we cannot apply any stream fucntion on the optional again.
 	
3.  Map(): transform 
    result is a stream



Nested collections are allowed :
=====================================

TreeMap<Seller,Treeset>
ArrayList<ArrayList<Product>>


Can we create custome collection :yes 
Arraylist which can store two duplicate and for third it will not take 

Serialization Example 
========================
Read from a file and write in the file 
fileoutputstream is to read from  afile and writeObject method is used write object and readObject is used to read object

JDBC:
==========
JDBC is provide as a connector in form of a jar 

Preparestatement:
=====================
1.Preparestatement use place holder like ? where ever is data use ?
Preparestatment pt =ct.prepareStatement("select * fromm demo where id = ?") ;
pt.setInt(1,100);
resultset rs=pt.executequery() ;

2.Ps are more secured sql injection is not possible using this it avoid any value insertion in between.

3.ExecuteUpdate for DML query it is used so any change in the db it will return no of records updated.

4.Callable is used for stored procedure

5.Maven project will provide all the dependency injected to our project automatically

6.For any maven project we can download the dependency from google and save in the pom.xml dont need to manually download any jar. 

Regex:
================

1. .s.
---- first character may be anything second should be s and after that anything
    like dss

2.  .?s.
---  Quantifiers in reges
     ?(0/1 of preceeding)  *(any number of precedding) + { }

3.For range []
---- b*s[a-zA-Z]

3. https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_regular_expressions.htm --site to refer 


Day03 :
==================

Assignments :
================
1)Assume  you are interacting with paymentgateway1 which allows to perform 
checkout(String carddetails,string expiray date,int pin ,String cardholdername) ,viewtransaction(Date  from , Date todate).
Assume that you are using PGAdapter which interacts with payement gateway1.

Now we want to change the code
2)further assume PaymentGateway1 is being replaced with PaymentGateway2() the methods provided by PaymentGateway2  are  transact(CardDetails cd),gettransaction().

3) Make necessary change to get the salary at director,Manager or developer level
director - direc+man+dev
manager =dev +dev



upload assignemnt in git 

Design pattern:
=================

Design pattern helps us to know how to design the solution of a problem
1.Singleton Design pattern :Only one object is created across the application example like notification bar multiple subpart is there but single notification bar is there.
Algo : make constructor private and use static variable to count the no of instance of a class is created  

Design types:

Creational                       Behavioural       Structure
Singleton(creation of object)   		   Facade(How to design the structure of class)


App

||

Module === App , Network , hardware

If i need to change anything app developer need to check its impact

FACADE:
============

APP

||

Platorm API (If i need to change anything only platorm api required change no where else)

||

Module === App , Network , hardware


Proxy Design Pattern :
======================

representing someone else and here we use proxy so that to improve performance

class videoplayer
{
	String filename ;
	video obj ;

video loadvideo()
{

}
}
when we create its object  it load complete video in video obj I want to create a albumn
i want to show all the videos in my albumn(all the video present are loaded in the memory because video object is created )
album have 9 video so all 9 will load in the memory even if i want to play only 1 or 2
It is not a good design because extra memory is utilising it si developed by someone what we can do
we create its proxy like


class videoplayerproxy
{
	String filename;
         videopalyer vplayer;
        getThumbnail()
	{
	 
	}
	void play()
	{
	  //onclick of play button only i am creating object not  already loading all the video in the memory
          videoplayer vp = new videoplayer();
	   vp.loadvideo();
	}
}


Adapter Design Pattern:
============================
Adapter adapts the interface change in the exisiting one 
your code

||| depends on
|||

Class xyz(this xyz is replaced with some other class ABC in future and it has some different methods now)
Now i need to change in my code 
so the solution is writing adapter class 

like Class xyz extends ABC
{
	make use of abc functionality and expose it as xyz
}


Builder Design Pattern :
======================
creating an object not relay on constructor use method

when we have more than 2-3 parameters there is chance of confusion  when we create object 
parameters values can be change for this we need to create cakebuilder
like setSugar(),setFlour(),setHoney()

cake is main class and cake builder is just an addon so that to avoid confusion of object creation

cake(float sugar, float flour1,float honey)

//make constructor private
class cake
{

	class static cakebuilder
	{

	}

}


Factory DEsign pattern :
============================

Which will create object and give us the object 
drivermanager.getConnection is exmaple drivermanager class is providing us the obejct of connection
On the basis of need factory will give object


Decorator :
=================

Fileinputstream fis = Fileinputstream fis() ;

we can refer the above as :
if(1)
Inputstream fis = Fileinputstream fis() ;

else
is =ByteArrayInputstream()

so basically the input we are asking on the runtime not on compile time like input from keyboard or file

//you can unread data using pushback 
Pushbackinputstream pbis = new Pushbackinputstream (fis)//inputstream
add/modifiy the object at runtime



Composite pattern :
===========================
population of various states then analysis need to be done by each state and district
so we need to follow parent child relation to store such data.

1.composite object in hirerachy like nodes and leaf
2.treat individual object and combine them

town

karnataka

dist1  dist2

t1 t2	t1  t2 



Mediator Design Pattern :
=============================
component1----componrnt5
	||
	||
	Mediator	
	||
	||
component2-- component5
component2 ---component4
component4----component3


now we need to change the component4 then all the dependent on component4 need to be change
reason is lot of efforts need to change and everything is tightly coupling
to solve this there can be a mediator class which then can interact with other


Day 04:
================
Servlet :

localhost:8080
//port number is used to run multiple application if it not there only one network application can be run.

Request:
Request Body

Response:
Status Code
Headers
Response Body

Cookie : Is a small piece of information can be stored on client and server machine

Headers : Accept,Content-Type etc 
Status code series: 1NN - for information purpose ,
		    2NN-ok ,
                    3NN-redirect,
          	    4NN-error/url is notfound ,
		    5NN--Exception/Network Problem/Configuration


1.Extends HttpServlet
2.Override doget/dopost method
3.In doGet --Request Body it is not there every thing need to give in query parameter
what we need to send present in the request object and what we need to give back present in response object

web.xml -Deployment Descirptor
Mapping between url and servlet class using web.xml or using annotation @webServelet("/") ;
configuration parameters 
filters

filters will check the chain in the web.xml and execute

MyFirstServlet example : for htmlservlet form example

Session :
===============
Http is a stateless protocol doesnot remember any state 
so thats why HTTP session is ued
	create a new session getSession() method will create new sesssion
	we can access the exisiting session
	we can remove or add attribute to or from a session -- session.setAttribute() to store anything in the session object
	destroy the session


Cookie is store at client machine.
servlet context:passing the parametr from web.xml so whenever we need to change we need to change in the .xml file 
JSP java server page is an extension of servlet code is compact and tags are there but .jsp file internally it creates the servlet and then .class file from servlet file which makes 
its execution slow.
